# Library Project

This project focused on building a simple Library app using JavaScript.

1. **Creating and Storing Objects**
   - Learned how to use a constructor function (`Book`) to create book objects with properties like title, author, and page count.
   - Stored these objects in an array (`myLibrary`), allowing for easy management and manipulation.

2. **Unique Identifiers**
   - Implemented `crypto.randomUUID()` to generate unique IDs for each book, ensuring that each book has a distinct identifier. This avoids conflicts when modifying or removing books.

3. **Interactivity with the DOM**
   - Gained experience in displaying dynamic content by looping through an array of books and rendering each one in the UI.
   - Manipulated the DOM to add, remove, and modify elements based on user interactions.

4. **Handling Form Inputs and Events**
   - Learned how to create forms and handle user input to add new books to the library.
   - Used `event.preventDefault()` to prevent form submissions from reloading the page, ensuring the form works as intended.

5. **Removing and Modifying Data**
   - Implemented functionality to remove a book from the library using its unique ID.
   - Added a button to toggle the "read" status of a book, learning how to modify object properties based on user actions.
